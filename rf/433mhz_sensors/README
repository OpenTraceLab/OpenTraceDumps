433MHz RF Sensor Signal Dumps
=============================

Collection of signal dumps from cheap 433MHz RF sensors commonly
used in home automation and weather monitoring applications.

Protocol Details:
-----------------
- Frequency: 433.92 MHz ISM band
- Modulation: OOK (On-Off Keying) or ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)
- Data encoding: Manchester, PWM, or proprietary
- Transmission: Periodic bursts with sensor data

Files:
------
- temp_humidity_sensor.sr: Temperature/humidity sensor
- door_window_sensor.sr: Door/window contact sensor  
- motion_pir_sensor.sr: PIR motion detector
