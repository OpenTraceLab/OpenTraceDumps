BISS (Bidirectional/Serial Synchronous) Protocol Examples
========================================================

This directory contains signal dumps for the BISS protocol, which is commonly
used in industrial position encoders and sensors.

BISS is a digital interface protocol that provides:
- Bidirectional communication
- High-speed data transmission
- Error detection capabilities
- Support for both absolute and incremental encoders

Files:
------
- biss_encoder_basic.sr: Basic BISS encoder communication
- biss_encoder_multiturn.sr: Multi-turn absolute encoder data
- biss_encoder_error.sr: BISS communication with error conditions

Protocol Details:
-----------------
- Clock frequency: Typically 1-10 MHz
- Data format: Synchronous serial
- Error detection: CRC checksum
- Typical applications: Industrial automation, robotics, CNC machines
