SENT (Single Edge Nibble Transmission) Protocol Signal Dumps
============================================================

SENT is a point-to-point communication protocol used primarily in automotive
applications for transmitting sensor data. It's defined by SAE J2716 standard.

Protocol Overview:
------------------
- Single-wire, unidirectional communication (sensor to ECU)
- Pulse-width modulated signal
- No clock signal required
- Robust against electromagnetic interference
- Commonly used for pressure, temperature, and position sensors

SENT Frame Structure:
--------------------
1. Synchronization/Calibration pulse (56 ticks)
2. Status and Communication nibble (4-8 ticks)
3. Data nibbles (typically 3-6 nibbles, 4-8 ticks each)
4. CRC nibble (4-8 ticks)
5. Optional pause pulse

Timing Specifications:
----------------------
- Tick time: Typically 3μs (can range from 3-90μs)
- Nibble encoding: 12-27 ticks for values 0-15
- Fast channel: Optional additional data in pause pulse

SENT Variants:
--------------
- SENT2010: Standard SENT protocol (SAE J2716)
- Enhanced SENT: With additional features like bidirectional communication
- Short PWM Code (SPC): Simplified version for basic sensors

Common Applications:
--------------------
- Automotive pressure sensors (MAP, fuel pressure)
- Temperature sensors (coolant, intake air)
- Position sensors (throttle position, pedal position)
- Torque sensors (steering, engine)

Signal Characteristics:
-----------------------
- Voltage levels: Typically 0V (low) and 5V or 12V (high)
- Current mode: Often current-driven for noise immunity
- Pull-up resistor: Required on receiving end
- EMC compliance: Designed for automotive EMC requirements
