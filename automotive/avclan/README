Toyota AVCLAN (Audio Visual Communication LAN) Protocol Dumps
============================================================

AVCLAN is Toyota's proprietary communication protocol used in their vehicles
for connecting audio, navigation, and other infotainment components.

Protocol Details:
-----------------
- Physical layer: Single-wire differential signaling
- Voltage levels: 0V (low), 12V (high), 6V (idle)
- Data rate: Typically 17.857 kbps
- Frame format: Start bit + Address + Data + Checksum + Stop bit
- Network topology: Multi-master bus with collision detection
- Used in: Toyota, Lexus vehicles (1990s-2000s)

Signal Characteristics:
-----------------------
- Idle state: ~6V (middle voltage)
- Logic '0': 0V (ground)
- Logic '1': 12V (battery voltage)
- Bit timing: ~56 Î¼s per bit
- Frame structure: Variable length packets

- avclan_cd_changer.sr: CD changer communication
- avclan_navigation.sr: Navigation system messages
- avclan_climate_control.sr: Climate control integration
- avclan_bus_idle.sr: Bus idle state and arbitration

Device Types (Common Addresses):
--------------------------------
- 0x100: Head unit (radio/navigation)
- 0x110: CD changer
- 0x120: Amplifier
- 0x130: Phone interface
- 0x140: Navigation system
- 0x150: Climate control interface
- 0x1A0: Steering wheel controls
- 0x1B0: Display unit

Message Format:
---------------
[Start][Master Address][Slave Address][Control][Data...][Checksum][Stop]

Notes:
------
AVCLAN was used primarily in Toyota and Lexus vehicles from the 1990s through
early 2000s before being replaced by more modern automotive bus systems like
CAN bus. The protocol allows for complex interactions between various vehicle
subsystems.
